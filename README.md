# Private Event

Project built to solidify more complex assocation concepts in rails.

The project is a web app consisting of a user and event model.
The associations used between these two models will be that of a has_many and belongs_to respectively. The User model will also be able to have attended many events via a third model used to implement the has_many through association thus building a many-to-many relationship with the model.
